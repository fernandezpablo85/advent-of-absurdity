# Advent of Absurdity

Overcomplicated projects to do simple stuff

## What?

We're going to build solutions to a problem, not because they're the best solution possible but because of the solution itself. Projects are going to be overcomplicated on purpose, just for the sake of the technology involved.

## Projects
